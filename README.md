bakery
======

A bakery that happens to specialize in pies.

This project is used for many things:
* Orchastration
* Organization
* Adventures with wizards.
* Stack organization.
* Configuration management enforcement.

Orchastration
-------------
The baker script is used to fire off commands to the various cloud providers to enforce state.

Organization
-------------
Berkshelf files are used to maintain cookbook versions.
Builds are essentially done by Berkshelf files.

Adventures
----------
Sometimes magic is used to make things work.  We try to stay away from the black arts, but
occationally bash will be used.  

Stacks
------
Stack definitions define how a stack should look and it's relative comonents.

Configuration
-------------
Force state with the configuration management system.
